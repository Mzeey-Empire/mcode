 * produces a {@link HandoffArtifact}. This module is the canonical home for
 * the artifact shape and the forker contract so the provider interface (which
 * lives in this package) can reference them without depending on the server.
 *
 * The server's `services/handoff/handoff-types.ts` re-exports these so
 * existing server-side imports keep working unchanged.
