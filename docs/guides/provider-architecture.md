# Provider Architecture Convention

All agent providers must use a **persistent process per session**, not per-turn spawning.

## Shared lifecycle: SessionRuntime + ProtocolAdapter

The uniform session lifecycle lives in `apps/server/src/services/session-runtime.ts`.
Each Provider holds its own `SessionRuntime<TState>` and implements
`ProtocolAdapter<TState>` (composition, not inheritance). The runtime owns the
session pool, the lazy 60s idle-eviction timer with a `lastUsedAt + isBusy`
guard, Windows `JobObject` attachment, the `EnvService` env snapshot, and the
graceful-interrupt-then-`taskkill /T /F` hard close — acting on the child PIDs
the adapter's `spawn` surfaces. The adapter supplies only `spawn`, `isBusy`,
`interrupt`, `close`, and `isStale`.

When adding a Provider, implement the `ProtocolAdapter` seam on the Provider
class and construct a `SessionRuntime` in its constructor; the pool, eviction,
JobObject, and hard-kill come for free. Do not hand-roll a session map or an
eviction timer. If the SDK hides the subprocess PID, return an empty `pids`
array from `spawn` and the runtime's JobObject/taskkill become best-effort
no-ops for that Provider (document it).

Both the Claude and Codex providers were originally built with per-turn process spawning
(via their respective SDKs). Both suffered the same reliability issues: stdin pipe timing
failures on Windows, abort signal races, and opaque error messages from stderr status lines
masking the real failure. Both were rewritten to use persistent processes.

When adding a new provider:

- Spawn one long-lived child process per session
- Communicate via stdin/stdout (JSON-RPC, NDJSON, or equivalent streaming protocol)
- Use graceful interruption (RPC call like `turn/interrupt`) before hard process kill
- On Windows, use `taskkill /T /F /PID <pid>` via execFile (not exec) for process tree
  cleanup - Node's `child.kill()` does not kill grandchildren on Windows
- Never pass `AbortSignal` directly to `spawn()` - manage cancellation via protocol-level
  interruption, not OS signals
- Guarantee `ended` event emission in every exit path (clean completion, error, crash, timeout)
- Filter stderr: classify lines as benign (debug log) or fatal (session teardown), never
  surface raw stderr as user-facing error messages
