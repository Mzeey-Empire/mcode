# Narrative Pipeline Guide

The live status line uses the latest active root tool's description, file action, or tool category.
Without an active tool, it shows a complete summary heading from the current open thought segment, or `Thinking...`.
The status line shows the step count only when it is greater than zero.
Completed tools and closed segments cannot keep an old activity label visible. The label stays on one line as its text changes.
Providers supply these details through the existing canonical tool and non-final text events. See [Activity labels](provider-architecture.md#activity-labels).

Hooks appear beside Copy and Fork on the final response, not beside the turn duration or as inline narrative rows.
Hover, click, or use Tab to open the panel. Press Escape to close it.
The panel lists triggers, available hook names, and consecutive run counts. It does not show output or payloads.
The icon shows a warning when a hook blocks or fails. Hooks come from the owning thread's
narrative cache, including hooks that arrive after turn persistence. Hooks still
separate tool groups in the chronological data; only their inline display is removed.

Active and completed commands use the same expandable Shell row. Active rows
show the activity animation in the command label and open automatically. A manual
close remains in effect while output changes. A tool result completes its
matched call; a new tool call or assistant message does not complete other calls.
Turn termination settles any outstanding calls. Completed calls retain the
existing command groups and remain available through manual expansion.

New live tool rows animate open. Completed rows animate closed before joining
their command group. This short visual transition does not delay completion
status or other tool updates. Reduced motion removes the transition.

Shell cards show the call status at the bottom right, outside the output viewport.
Hover over the command or output to copy that section. Keyboard focus also reveals
the copy action. Output preserves whitespace and scrolls horizontally and vertically
inside the card. The output copy button stays fixed while the content scrolls.
Calls without command text show a plaintext output card without a synthetic command.

The narrative timeline is the chronological audit trail rendered inside each
assistant turn: tool calls, sub-agents, thoughts, hooks, and the streaming
response. It looks simple. It is not. This guide documents the contracts and
the specific traps we hit so the next person doesn't trip on them.

If you are about to touch any of these files, **read this first**:

- `apps/server/src/features/providers/` (runtime event source and provider projection)
- `apps/server/src/features/agents/conversation/narrative/narrative-store.ts` (write seam: enrichment +
  classification + persistence; owns the per-turn buffers and the
  `agentCallStack`. Also owns the read seam, `load`.)
- `apps/server/src/features/agents/orchestration/agent-service.ts` (turn orchestration; delegates
  the write seam to NarrativeStore and retains turn-level concerns: turn snapshots,
  `turn.persisted` broadcast, and late-hook flushing)
- `apps/server/src/index.ts` (broadcast layer)
- `apps/web/src/stores/threadStore.ts` (validated AgentEvent projection and
  client volatile state lifecycle)
- `apps/web/src/stores/conversation-residency.ts` (selected conversation
  residency, bounded retention, refresh, pagination, and prefetch routing)
- `apps/web/src/components/chat/narrative/*` (renderers)
- `apps/web/src/components/chat/virtual-items.ts` (timeline insertion point)

## Transcript position and turn ownership

The pinned prompt uses the chat content width and leaves space for an open Thread overview.

Live and saved activity render inline in chronological order. Long turns keep
all narrative text in the chat, with no summary view or activity pagination.
Tool groups retain their existing detail expanders.

The current turn's runtime lifecycle controls its response state, footer, Stop
control, and follow-up queue decision. Saved message outcomes and canonical
history cannot override an active local execution. Provider-owned child threads
use their canonical lifecycle when no local execution owns the thread.

Match the current response by thread and response ID or outcome execution ID.
Keep its terminal footer hidden during running and finalizing. Keep earlier
turns' footers visible. On termination, use the current lifecycle outcome.

The chat viewport uses vlist. React owns each row's content through a portal;
vlist owns row placement. A continuous ResizeObserver updates row heights when
streaming text, images, or disclosures change size.

The viewport has one position: follow the tail, retain a reading row and pixel
offset, or align a navigation target. Upward scrolling stops tail following.
Returning to the bottom resumes it. Prepends and resident-history eviction retain
the reading row when that row remains available. Each rendered thread has its own
viewport, and the existing thread cache stores its reading anchor.

The clipped prompt follows the turn at the top of the viewport, including older
turns. It hides while that prompt remains visible. Its jump control returns to
that prompt, not the latest user message. Selection uses resident row positions,
so the original prompt does not need a mounted DOM row.

Reasoning and tool groups are separate measured rows, including within one long
turn. Only visible rows and overscan mount in the DOM. Cached transcript data
does not require mounted rows. Narrative keys use the execution identity so
completion and cache hydration retain the same reading anchor.

Expanded tool groups insert their children into this same viewport as separate
rows. The summary stays at its current position when it opens or closes. Group
expansion survives row unmounts and cached thread switches. A single command's
output remains part of that command row. Clicking a disclosure retains its row
position, even while the viewport follows the tail. Group children animate open
and closed without losing per-row virtualization. Reduced motion removes this
height transition. Reopening a group during collapse reverses the transition.

`components/ui/virtual-viewport.ts` owns measurement, row hosts, and scroll
positions. `VirtualRows` mounts the visible React portals. The transcript wrapper
adds tail-follow policy; other features start at the top and supply their own
row data, expansion state, and renderer. Reuse these primitives for another
virtual list without copying chat behavior or adding a nested scroll viewport.

Live narrative can appear before a persisted assistant response only when the
current turn identifies that response. Otherwise, new activity appends after the
existing conversation. A previous answer is not an insertion point for a new turn.

```

Every step has at least one trap. Read on.

The live status line always uses the layers icon. Its step count, optional
subagent count, and activity label share a text shimmer while the turn runs.
The elapsed time stays static between ticks. The shimmer and icon motion stop
when the turn ends and are disabled when reduced motion is preferred.

Provider-native identity and child evidence stay before the adapter boundary.
The narrative pipeline, WebSocket payload, and renderer receive only
provider-neutral `AgentEvent` data. This keeps child lifecycle persistence
private while preserving normal sub-agent rows in the parent timeline.

### Renderer ownership

`ConversationResidency`, registered by `threadStore`, is the renderer's only
conversation authority. It selects and restores a Thread's persisted
conversation, retains inactive records within the bounded cache, and routes
refresh, pagination, and prefetch work to `ThreadHydrator`. `workspaceStore`
owns rows and selection, not a second conversation cache or restore path.

The server owns durable messages and persisted narrative metadata. The renderer
projects validated `AgentEvent` values into each resident Thread record. This
split preserves the volatile Turn layer through `turn.persisted`; persistence
confirms durable narrative data but does not end the live timeline.

### Residency certification

Run this command from the repository root:

```sh
bun run certify:conversation --output .dev/verification/conversation-certification.json
```

The certification checks the production byte policy with 100-message and
1,000-message histories. It reports active and inactive conversation records,
prefetched history, narrative metadata, and process memory diagnostics.

The active conversation budget is 13 MiB: message rows may use 8 MiB, while
narrative metadata has 4 MiB and the remainder covers record metadata. The
inactive record budget is 16 MiB and prefetched history is limited to 4 MiB.
Under pressure, remove prefetched history first, then inactive records. Reduce
active message rows to 4 MiB only after those classes are empty, while keeping
the visible message anchor and both page boundaries.

## Thought vs final response classification

Multiple layers classify streamed text. Use this precedence when debugging
misclassified preamble or duplicate assistant bodies:

1. **`AssistantMessageBoundary`** (authoritative) — emitted from
   `claude-provider.ts` when an SDK `assistant` message carries text and a
   `stop_reason`. `{end_turn, stop_sequence, max_tokens}` → final response;
   everything else (including `tool_use`) → preamble/thought.
2. **`TextDelta.isFinalResponse`** (stream hint) — best-effort flag set on
   `content_block_delta` when all tools have resolved and at least one tool
   fired this turn. May be absent on tool-free turns; boundary event wins.
3. **Client segment routing** — `threadStore` retracts or closes the open
   thought segment on `session.assistantMessageBoundary`. Final response text
   stays in the thread streaming buffer and renders via a provisional
   assistant message item, not `thoughtSegmentsByThread`.
4. **Persist suffix match** — `narrative-store.ts` `persistNarrative` tags the
   last matching thought row `is_final_response` before DB insert as a safety
   net for older rows or reconnect gaps.

**Don't break this:** dropping the boundary handler or counting thought
segments in `NarrativeIndicator.stepCount` will diverge live counts from
`PersistedTurnFooter` (Trap 6).

## Trap 1: `parent_tool_use_id` is the only source of truth for parallel sub-agents

**Symptom.** Four sub-agents dispatched in parallel. Three of them render with
no nested children; one of them has all twelve calls clumped underneath.

**Root cause.** The `agentCallStack` is a LIFO of Agent tool call IDs pushed
in dispatch order. `getCurrentParentToolCallId` returns the top of the stack.
For sequential dispatch this works. For parallel dispatch the stack ends as
`[a1, a2, a3, a4]` and the top is always `a4` — so every child gets
misattributed to `a4`.

**The rule.** The Claude Agent SDK puts `parent_tool_use_id` on every stream
message that originates inside a sub-agent. **That is the authoritative
source.** The agent-call stack is only a fallback for code paths where the
SDK doesn't surface this field (older paths, edge cases).

**Where this is wired:**

- `claude-provider.ts` reads `anyMsg.parent_tool_use_id` and forwards it as
  `parentToolCallId` on the `ToolUse` event.
- `index.ts` checks `if (event.parentToolCallId)` first — if set,
  leave it. Only falls back to `narrativeStore.getCurrentParentToolCallId`
  when the SDK omitted it.
- `narrative-store.ts bufferToolCall` does the same dance for the persistence
  buffer: SDK value wins, stack is a fallback. (AgentService's `bufferToolCall`
  is a thin wrapper that delegates here, then persists TodoWrite task state.)

**Stack fallback contract:** `getCurrentParentToolCallId` does **not** return
`stack[stack.length - 1]`. It only returns a parent when **exactly one** Agent
ID on `agentCallStack` still has `status: "running"` in the in-memory turn
buffer. Otherwise it returns `undefined` so coordinator tool calls after
parallel subagents do not inherit the last subagent as their parent. Nested
agents with two running Agent rows rely on the SDK field (as they should).

**Don't break this:** any new code path that emits `ToolUse` events must
read `parent_tool_use_id` from the SDK message and propagate it as
`parentToolCallId` on the event. If you write to the buffer or broadcast
without it, parallel sub-agents will silently lose nesting.

---

## Trap 2: do NOT clear `agentCallStack` on `textDelta`

**Symptom.** A sub-agent's children stop nesting partway through its run —
new child tool calls appear at the top level instead of under the parent.

**Root cause.** The Claude SDK emits `textDelta` events from sub-agents
while they are still issuing child tool calls. An earlier version of the
agent-service cleared `agentCallStack` on `textDelta` events, reasoning that
"if the agent is producing text, it's wrapping up." That was wrong — a
sub-agent emits text mid-flight, and clearing the stack causes subsequent
child `toolUse` events to lose their fallback parent ID.

**The rule.** `agentCallStack` is only cleared:

1. When a `toolResult` arrives for an Agent call (the agent finished — pop it
   from the stack via `updateBufferedToolCallOutput`).
2. When a final `Message` event arrives (turn over — clear the whole stack).
3. When the session ends.

**Never on `textDelta`. Never on streaming events.** The stack now lives on
`narrative-store.ts`; its `openOrExtendThought` (the textDelta path) never
touches `agentCallStack`. See the explanatory comment in the AgentService
`TextDelta` handler.

---

## Trap 3: client volatile state survives `turn.persisted`

**Symptom.** Agent finishes, the assistant message renders, but the timeline
above it disappears. User reports "we're not seeing logs after the agent
finished."

**Root cause.** The previous design rendered a `ToolCallSummary` block under
each persisted assistant message that lazy-fetched tool call records from
SQLite. We deleted that component when we introduced `TurnFooter`. But the
client store was still clearing volatile state on `turn.persisted` — the
narrative timeline relies on `toolCallsByThread`, `thoughtSegmentsByThread`,
and `hooksByThread` being non-empty. With them cleared, the
`narrative-flow` virtual item stops being emitted.

**The rule.** Volatile narrative state for a thread lives from the first
`session.toolUse` of a turn until the **next** turn begins. Specifically:

| Event                       | Action                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `session.turnStarted` (new) | Clear toolCalls / thoughts / hooks / start fresh           |
| `session.toolUse`           | Append                                                     |
| `session.toolResult`        | Update                                                     |
| `session.thoughtSegment`    | Append                                                     |
| `session.turnComplete`      | Keep everything; mark tool calls `isComplete: true`        |
| `turn.persisted`            | Keep everything — DB write is informational only           |
| Next `sendMessage` call     | Clear toolCalls / thoughts / hooks (belt-and-suspenders)   |

`agentStartTimes[threadId]` follows the same lifecycle as the audit trail —
**do not clear it on `turnComplete`** or `TurnFooter` will lose its
`startTime` reference and the `completedDurationMs` `useMemo` returns null,
making the footer show "—" for duration.

**Don't break this:** any future "cleanup on turn end" code that touches
`toolCallsByThread`, `thoughtSegmentsByThread`, `hooksByThread`, or
`agentStartTimes` must clear at `turnStarted` / `sendMessage` time, not at
`turnComplete` / `turn.persisted` time.

**Known follow-up:** on a full page reload, the volatile state is lost, so
completed-turn audit trails for previously-rendered turns don't reappear.
The fix is to hydrate from `tool_call_records` (and a future
`thought_segments` / `hook_executions` table) when loading messages. Not
done yet.

## Trap 4: do NOT mutate the React-owned DOM tree for the typing cursor

**Symptom.** Random `NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on
'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child
of this node.` crashing the whole `NarrativeFlow` subtree mid-stream. The
visible artifact is that sub-agent rows render but their bodies stay empty,
because the commit phase aborted before reconciling them.

**Root cause.** An earlier version of `DeltaBlock.tsx` tried to inject the
typing cursor inline at the end of the last text node by calling
`target.appendChild(cursor)` inside `useLayoutEffect`. React's fiber tree
still thought the cursor was a direct child of the root `<div>`. When the
markdown content changed mid-stream, React's commit phase called
`insertBefore` on the root's children list — the cursor wasn't where it
expected, so the call threw, and the commit was aborted.

A naive cleanup function that restored the cursor to root on unmount
**did not fix this** — React's mid-render reconciliation can run
`insertBefore` *before* the cleanup gets a chance to fire.

**The rule.** Never `appendChild`, `insertBefore`, `removeChild`, or
`replaceChild` against a node that lives inside a React-managed subtree.
React owns the children list of every element it rendered, and any mutation
that contradicts the fiber tree's expectation throws.

**The fix used in `DeltaBlock.tsx`:** keep the cursor as a permanent sibling
inside the root div (React-managed, never moved). After every render, a
`useLayoutEffect` measures the bounding rect of the END of the last
text-bearing element via `document.createRange()` + `collapse(false)`, and
sets `left` / `top` / `height` inline styles on the cursor (which uses
`position: absolute`). The DOM tree React rendered is left untouched.

**Don't break this:** if you need to overlay something visually inside a
React subtree, either:

1. Position absolutely against a measured rect (this pattern).
2. Use `ReactDOM.createPortal` to render into a node React knows about.
3. Render the overlay element as a sibling at the root level and use CSS
   to position it.

Do not reach for `appendChild` ever again.

---

## Trap 5: `useMemo` cannot contain `Date.now()` for "freeze on completion"

**Symptom.** `TurnFooter` duration displays "—" even though the turn
completed and the timestamps look right.

**Root cause.** An early version of `NarrativeFlow.tsx` computed
`completedDurationMs` inside a `useMemo` using `Date.now()`. Two problems:
(1) `useMemo` is supposed to be pure, and using a non-deterministic source
makes the cache key meaningless; (2) on re-renders triggered by `toolCalls`
or `thoughtSegments` array reference changes (which happen even after the
turn ends, e.g. on reconnect replay), `Date.now()` re-samples and the
duration drifts.

**The rule.** To freeze a wall-clock value at a state transition, use
`useState` + `useEffect`:

```tsx
const [completedAt, setCompletedAt] = useState<number | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (isAgentRunning) {
    setCompletedAt(null);  // reset on turn restart
  } else if (completedAt == null) {
    setCompletedAt(Date.now());  // snapshot on first not-running render
  }
}, [isAgentRunning, completedAt]);

const completedDurationMs = useMemo<number | null>(() => {
  if (isAgentRunning || startTime == null || completedAt == null) return null;
  return Math.max(0, completedAt - startTime);
}, [isAgentRunning, startTime, completedAt]);
```

The snapshot lives in state (so it survives re-renders), gets set exactly
once when `isAgentRunning` flips false, and resets when a new turn starts.

---

## Trap 6: `topLevel.length` includes Agent calls in the step count

This is **intentional**, not a bug. Documenting it here because reviewers
have flagged it twice as a "double-count."

`NarrativeCounts.steps` counts every top-level tool call — including Agent
calls. `NarrativeCounts.subagents` separately counts top-level Agent calls.
So a turn with 3 Reads and 1 Agent reads as "4 steps · 1 sub-agent" — the
sub-agent is one of the four steps, not a fifth.

The labeling in `TurnFooter` reads correctly as "N steps, of which K were
sub-agents." Don't try to "fix" this by subtracting Agent calls from
`steps`. See the doc comment on `NarrativeCounts.steps`
(`apps/web/src/components/chat/narrative/types.ts`) for the canonical
semantics.

---

## Testing checklist for narrative changes

When you modify any file in the pipeline above, verify all of these manually
before reporting the change done:

- **Single tool call:** sends, completes, shows under timeline, persists.
- **Sequential sub-agents:** parent calls Agent A, A completes, parent calls
  Agent B. Both A's and B's children nest under the right parent.
- **Parallel sub-agents:** parent calls 4 Agents in one assistant turn.
  All four show their own children nested correctly. None of the children
  appear at top level.
- **Nested sub-agents:** Agent A dispatches Agent B. B's children nest under
  B, which nests under A.
- **Thoughts mid-tool-call:** thought rows interleave with tool calls in
  chronological order.
- **Long thought:** clamps to 2 lines with `show more` toggle.
- **Streaming response:** typing cursor sits inline at the end of the last
  word — not on its own line below the last paragraph.
- **Turn completion:** timeline stays visible, `TurnFooter` appears with
  steps/thoughts/sub-agents counts and a stable duration.
- **Next turn:** sending a new message clears the previous trail and starts
  a fresh timeline.
- **Browser console:** no `NotFoundError`, no React warnings.

The unit suite at `apps/web/src/components/chat/narrative/__tests__/`
covers the count derivation but not the full event flow. Manual
verification via the running app is required.

---

## Quick-reference invariants

If you change something and one of these stops being true, you are about to
ship a bug:

1. Every `ToolUse` event broadcast to the client carries `parentToolCallId`
   (either from SDK or from the agentCallStack fallback).
2. `agentCallStack` is mutated only by `bufferToolCall` (push on Agent),
   `updateBufferedToolCallOutput` (pop on Agent result), and the
   `Message`-event clear at end of turn.
3. `toolCallsByThread`, `thoughtSegmentsByThread`, `hooksByThread`, and
   `agentStartTimes` survive `turnComplete` and `turn.persisted`. They are
   cleared only at `turnStarted` / `sendMessage`.
4. No React-rendered DOM node is moved via `appendChild` / `insertBefore` /
   etc.
5. Wall-clock snapshots use `useState` + `useEffect`, not `useMemo`.
6. `NarrativeCounts.steps` is the count of top-level tool calls only — not
   thought segments. Live `narrative-indicator` must use the same definition.
7. Final response text renders as a provisional assistant message item;
   preamble text renders as thought rows inside `narrative-flow`. The
   `AssistantMessageBoundary` event is the authoritative split.
