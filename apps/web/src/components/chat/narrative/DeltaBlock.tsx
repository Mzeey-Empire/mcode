 *   current target (e.g. the first batched flush of text deltas) — producing
 *   a visible typewriter reveal instead of the full text popping in.
 * - When `isStreaming` is true on first mount with a LONG initial target,
 *   we assume a remount into an in-flight stream (e.g. thread-switch back
 *   during streaming). `displayed` starts at `target.length - REMOUNT_TAIL_CHARS`
 *   so only the last few chars typewriter in, avoiding the multi-hundred-char
 *   "dump" the user would otherwise see.
 * - When `isStreaming` is false, `displayed` starts at `target` and the loop
 *   never runs — completed segments render their full text immediately on
 *   mount so persisted history doesn't re-typewriter when scrolled into view.
 *
 * Idle rate: ~6 chars per animation frame (≈360 chars/sec at 60fps).
 * Catch-up: `step = clamp(6, ceil(behind / 8), 28)` — each frame closes
 * roughly 1/8 of the gap, capped so even huge coalesced batches still read
 * as fast typing rather than a single-frame paste.

 * displayed value resets immediately and the animation cancels.
