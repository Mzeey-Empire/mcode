 * The actual diff-aware Markdown renderer. Kept in a separate module so
 * DiffPreview can lazy-load it — the react-markdown + remark-gfm + plugin
 * surface is meaningful weight to defer until the user opens Preview.
 *
 * Highlighting is delivered as `[data-diff-added]` attributes set by the
 * remark plugin; Tailwind arbitrary selectors style any descendant that
 * carries the attribute. We deliberately don't override per-tag
 * components — letting react-markdown render defaults keeps the surface
 * minimal and avoids competing with the global Markdown styles.
