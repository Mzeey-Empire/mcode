Run `bun run verify:e2e` and show the output.

Requires `bun run dev:web` to be running, or the script will auto-start it.

Use after UI changes that touch interactive components, keyboard navigation, focus trapping, responsive layout, accessibility semantics, floating overlays, or persisted state. See `docs/guides/agent-workflow.md` for the full trigger list.
